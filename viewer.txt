Using the back end files already implemented, we'll add a GUI viewer
that can visualize the data and its transformations.

Features will include:

* forward and backward traversal
* autoplay with configurable intervals
* data input mode for specification of initial values
* user configurable alive/dead image files
* user configurable model and calculator classes

The viewer will be implemented in JRuby and use Java Swing for the GUI.
Thus, to run the viewer it will be necessary to use JRuby.
The easiest way to do this is with rvm.
